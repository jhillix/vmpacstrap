# Thoughts for future tests

* Build image, run it under Qemu or some other way. Then do some basic
  testing of the running system. For example, boot it under
  qemu-system-i386, with a serial consoler, and verify that it's
  possible to log in via the serial consoler, and ping the host.
  More detailed testing of built systems may or may not be
  appropriate: a lot of more intricate testing may be beyond the scope
  of testing of vmpacstrap.
* Use the lava-submit.py script to submit a local file to LAVA using
  the locally installed lava-dispatcher.
